# golang-lexer-example

This repository is a simple demonstration of how one can write a lexer and parser in Go. This technique is based on the implementation of `text/template` in the Go Standard Library. Rob Pike explains the advantages of this design in a talk from 2011 which was recorded and is [available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxaD_trXwRE).

Happy Reading.
